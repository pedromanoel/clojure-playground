# Clojure Playground

This project contains my explorations of the clojure language.

## Namespaces

Each namespace contains a different exploration/exercise:

* `code-arcade` - solutions to exercises from [Code Signal
  Arcade][code-arcade].
* `hacker-rank` - solutions to exercises from [Hacker Rank]
  [hacker-rank].
* `tdd` - katas from [TDD Manifesto Katas][tdd-katas].
* `spec` - my studies on [clojure.spec][clojure.spec].

## Tests

I'm a huge advocate of unit tests, so all my exercises are
tested!

There are some exercises that are purely in the test namespace:

* `destructuring` - my understandings about [destructuring]
  [destructuring] in test format.
